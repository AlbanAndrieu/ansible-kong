# Why no task for updating an exiting route?
#
# The properties that are used to find a matching route are the very properties that
# may change so as to update the route. Consider that:
#     route = hosts + paths + methods + protocols
# ...if any of the properties above change for a given route config then that implies
# the new config won't be of any use in matching an existing route. It would have been
# way easier if route object had a "name" property that should be unique and can be set.
#
# So for this very reason, it is not practical to have an `update route object` task.
# Hence, it is omitted on purpose.
#
# How do you update an existing route object then?
#     - create a replacement route object config
#     - delete the existing route object config
